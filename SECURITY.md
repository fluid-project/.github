# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Fluid community has a closed-membership security working group who are available to respond to possible security issues, consisting of a small group of committers to Fluid-related projects.

Any suspected security vulnerabilities can be reported privately by email to <security@fluidproject.org>. These messages will be forwarded to members of the security working group, who are responsible for working with contributors with relevant expertise and the reporter to address the issue in a timely manner.

For more details see the [Security](https://fluidproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/fluid/pages/11579384/Security) wiki page.
